If you buy the iPhone 8 it won't get updates for as long as this one.

It will likely go cheaper or the carriers will have specials on it.

You can get it for a cheaper price if you sell your old iPhone or trade it in.

If you want value for your money that can be found with older android phones. If you want value for your money and don't care about anything else you probably are not looking at buying an iPhone. I have a LG V20 that has a removable battery and I paid $65 for it, that is value for your money. Yes this is my daily driver phone and I play Pokemon Go on it just fine! For someone who just needs a phone to do basic things this phone will serve you just fine. These phones can be found for $65 to $100. I am sure there is a plethora of used android devices that can be found for under $100 that still perform for a large number of users."

I work with a lot of data on sd cards, and I'd have to deal with itunes to put the stuff on the phone - no, I'm not switching to mac or not doing what I do normally just for a fast phone.

But I miss smaller phones. There should be more phones with the size of the S10e/11 Pro/SE."

A good 400$ android smartphone would be able to outperform this smartphone in battery life, which is one of the most important aspects of a phone. A smartphone that is noticeably better in both screen and battery life could make it a better offer than this Iphone SE 2020, despite it losing in nearly every other aspect.

I would personally prefer something like the upcoming Pixel 4a. There are also smartphones like the Pixel 3a and Samsung S10e, which I definitely think are competitive, as a result of the Pixel 3a being significantly cheaper in Denmark, while the Samsung S10e has strong internals, great screen and good battery life."

Got a brilliant AMOLED display without any notch or punch hole, thanks to the pop-up camera. Lightning fast, fast charge up to 27W, 3 camera with ultrawide lenses etc etc (you can find it anyway)...

Does the new iPhone SE worth it for the ppl who want a small apple product? Definitely. I'm sure if I would be an iPhone 6 or 7 owner and wanted something similar, then I  would grab this phone for sure.

Is this a value champion, compared to any ""flagship killer"" 400$-ish Android phone? Not by a long shot."

However, this means, for me, that pressure is now on Android manufacturers to step up and start offering the same level of quality at the same price. So, this is good for us all.

However, Android Police needs to change it's name because all they've done so far is slag Google and Android phones off for months. When this phone dropped they had something like ""ANDOIRD IZ DED LEL"" as a headline, rather than report that this is great news for Android fans as the pressure mounts on manufacturers to compete."

I have to say, my 2XL has been a champ, and I'm not in a rush to replace it, but I could use a refresh.  The only thing stopping me from updating to the 4a at the moment is the lack of an IP rating.  I'm sure that means it won't be water resistant in any way, and I spend a lot of time on or near the water.  I'm also bummed there won't be an XL option, but I can live with the smaller screen at this price point.

Otherwise, it's wait for the 4 to drop in price, and get the IP68 along with wireless charging and the extra camera."

In Geekbench 5, which evaluates overall system performance, the Pixel 4a achieved a multi-core score of 1,647 points; the iPhone SE managed 3,226, and with just one of the A13 Bionic’s six cores, it hit 1,331 alone. The Pixel 4a also took far longer to dispatch our Adobe Premiere Rush video encoding test, clocking 2 minutes and 27 seconds to convert a minute-long 4K video clip to 1080p. The iPhone SE needed just 47 seconds for the same task.

Jesus Christ how is Apple so far ahead here?"

I had my Pixel 1 for about around two years and never used a case. I'm a clumsy as hell and drop my phone all the time, usually about 4ft up on hardwood floor and it never cracked. I had my 3a for three days before I dropped it once about waist high on the same floor and managed to crack the screen pretty badly. It was even in a case. My brother has had the same phones as me and my experience seems to reflect his as well, no cracks on original Pixel,  big cracks on 3a. Just something to consider, they have to cut costs somewhere on these phones."

I've been desperately needing a phone for awhile to replace my underperforming Moto G5s plus.  I heard early this year about the 4a and the SE.  I read everything I could about them while I patiently waited for them to release.  

The SE released, but the 4a got delayed.  Then it got delayed again. Then it got delayed again. Then it got delayed again.  

After having been in the Android environment since 2012 I switched to the SE because I couldn't wait any longer on the 4a.  

For those of you who were able to wait for the 4a I hope you like it. I would have liked a chance to try it out."

He claimed that the phones support 45w wired charging even though that claim has already been debunked.  I tested my 16 ProMax numerous times with different cables and powerbricks and the most I got was 29 watts.  He is just playing it safe so that he continues to get sponsorship $$$.  He just regurgitates the same stats in different videos over and over presenting them as if they are new.

I know, Apple wants people to buy the 16 Pros, but there is no reason why this wouldn’t be able to come to the 15 Pros.

Always like Nilay’s reviews. I wonder if a reviewer will finally bring up the one thing I’ve always thought after seeing the camera control UIUX, which nobody mentioned. Which is that it genuinely has to take much longer and a more clunky process to set some settings. Let’s say you want to increase exposure, then turn off night mode manually, and then use the 3x lens. There is zero world in which it feels better or faster than using the new shiny camera control button lol, compared to just using the screen."

I specify this because as this review goes live, so will dozens of others. All of these people have been using the phone for more or less the same amount of time, and all impressions you read from blogs and news outlets today will be based upon five or fewer days with the phones. I am going to keep thoughts on certain items - battery life and general performance, for example - a bit more concise because of this. It's hard to know confidently just how good the battery life is for me yet. It's also hard to know how much the phone will slow down over time. So I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that this review is the end-all, be-all of our thoughts on the Pixel phones, nor to suggest that our impressions are definitive and supported by the week or two we typically afford to the review process. Thoughts are still evolving. That said, we did want to provide this review at the time Google allowed us to publish it, and I hope that this disclaimer gives you some transparency into that whole process.

Honestly this is the kind of reason AP is so valued in this community."

""**Enhanced backup**

This one actually has flown under the radar, and I'm not sure why. The Google Pixels automatically back up your apps, app data, contacts, SMS (!), Wi-Fi passwords, call history, and various settings in Google Drive. Now, Android has done some of this for years. Contacts in your Google account, for example, are old hat. But SMS is new, and automatic app data backup in Drive is still fairly low on adoption, so hopefully this ""all in one"" backup being advertised as a Pixel feature will get developers to utilize it more.

DSC05283

But the big idea here is that Google wants you to have an iPhone-like experience when you set up your next Pixel a year or two from now - everything should just come over. Whether it will work that well in practice, we'll have to see.

I did not test the new cabled restore system on the Pixel, but Google seems pretty psyched about it, especially since it works with iPhones. I'd be curious myself to see how that experience would be.""

But it's that one time you go to bring up Maps and it's out of memory on your Galaxy S7 and it takes like 10 seconds to load up but you really need to get directions somewhere because you're stopped at a light and you have to decide if you're going left or right ahead. When it's crunch time, the Pixel always seem to maintain its composure and get you where need to go. In short? It feels a bit more like an iPhone. """

* Which one has better battery life? Intuitively the XL has a much larger capacity, but it is running a QHD screen vs the Pixel's HD.  
* Why on earth is Assistant a big deal? It looks to me like a minor update to Google Now. Does nothing new besides maintain context.  
* I use Nova launcher, so don't have swipe access to the Google Now cards page. Now that the long press gesture takes you to Assistant, is there no way to get to the cards pane directly? I've always disabled Now on Tap, cuz the cards are way more valuable to me.  "

The Good:

• Camera

• Battery Life

• Google's Android and perks

• Speed

• Four carriers

The Not So Good:

• Price

• Speaker

• Non-expandable storage

• A bit dull"

I switched to the 15 plus because of the big screen and bigger battery. I knew I’d miss the 120hz, but I’ve gotten used to it cos animations are so smooth. 

The battery life for me is amazing, I can get up to 7 hours SOT, with my charge limited to 80 percent , the cameras are great, takes good photos and videos, but sadly no RAW formats on the non pro model. 

I agree too that apps just seem to be more polished and refined for iOS
 The keyboard could be better, no universal back gesture sucks, the photos app is a mess for me, doesn’t seem very intuitive, especially compared to android

It’s a slick device but my primary fear that I’ve always had about iPhones is somewhat true: you don’t get to tell the iPhone how to work, it tells you how you will use it. 

Rearrange apps in folders the App Library screen? Nope. 

A simple vibration mode between silent and “on” to make all notifications only vibrate and no sound without silencing all apps as well.  Nope.

Native Apple apps don’t actually contain settings for the app in the app? Nope, exit the app got to settings and scroll down to apps and scroll down to your app and find the settings there. So weird. 

These are just minor frustrations that I assume I’ll get used to but it’s a bit of a culture shock to have such a curated os experience after using Android for so long.  Again, the philosophy seems to be that Apple knows the best way for you to use a phone so you better change."

That’s because step tracking is inherently inaccurate measured from the wrist (in some cases aggressively typing on a keyboard registers as hundreds of steps) as well as not giving an accurate indication of physical activity. Running 8000 steps is gonna burn a lot more calories than walking the same amount. The 10.000 steps per day rule was made as a rough guideline so people focussed on their activity more, it’s not actually that representative of fitness.

Yes. It just work, indeed. As a graphic design student at that time, one thing I noticed right away was the visuals are dozen times much nicer and consistent than android. Built in apps got more features and capability than the android ones. For example, I was heavy on pdf usage at that time, on android I had no choice but install a pdf viewer because the file manager can’t open it, but on iPhones I don’t need that cause it’s directly previewed inside the File app. I also had to download reminder and notes apps on android but iPhone came preinstalled with them, which is also much more featured than the ones I installed on my previous android phones. The next big thing I noticed were I’m free from messy file manager and gallery simply because WhatsApp didn’t automatically send anything I downloaded to Photos and Files unlike android. The next one I loved about the switche were the lock screen media playback control are actually useful, it got seekbar and volume slider apart from the play and next/prev button. The siri at that time is also already integrated to Music even though I only impored mp3s through iTunes. I can pretty much ask siri to play a specific artist/album/playlist and it plays it right away. These things are not existed on android at that time, even to this day most likely unless I use spotify. Overall all apps are simply integrated with each others. Spotlight saves a lot of time cause it can show result from every apps even 3rd party. I never look back to android since then."

On Android, there were times I had to practically fight with an app to get it to work properly.

This was me when I switched over to the iPhone back in the iPhone 6 days. I don’t know if this is still a thing, but any time I got a new android phone, the first thing I’d have to do was to root it, then install a fresh ROM that was free of all the bloat (do we really need 3 app stores from the ISP, Samsung and Google???). It was fun tinkering at first, but I got to the point where I just didn’t have time to do this anymore just to get a phone I bought to not be full of apps I never asked for. I haven’t looked back since. "

When I come across someone who doesn't care about tinkering on their phones to get it exactly the way they want, I just recommend an iPhone because like you said, it just works. However, if you're a power user and you want to make things exactly the way you want, Android offers way more options. Apple is getting better but they lag behind in this regard. Apple drives me nuts with some things that are very simple to implement but they refuse to do so because they want you to do things their way."

Mostly agree except I have no idea what you mean by “fight with the app” the closest thing I can think you mean is close and reopen it. And I have to be honest I’ve already had to do that with my iPhone over the last month as well several times.

I also don’t know what you mean by missing notifications, I never missed a notification in my nearly 15 years of using android. I missed a few on my iPhone but that is user error as I’m still adjusting, not anything against the phone.

I myself primarily switched because of the camera. iPhone camera is like a generational leap ahead of android on nearly all fronts. I have a child and want to be able to get good pictures of her and be able to process them and share them with my wife. The iPhone has been able to do that seamlessly and easily."

As someone who used Android before getting their first iOS device, there are so many things that bother me. First is the search option if I’m swiping down, it opens the search function, even though there’s already a search button on the home screen. When I swipe down, it should open the notification bar and control center.

Another issue is the keyboard. The iOS keyboard is nowhere near as good as GBoard, and even the GBoard version on iOS is terrible. Gmail was much better on Android compared to the iPhone.

If I stay on my phone too much, I probably don't want it because I can't access Facebook, Reddit, etc. If I don't, I don't need it because I know how to put the phone down.

They're targeting the very narrow number of people who know they use their phone too much and want to stop, but need to cut that connection off. They're basically running Alcoholic Anonymous for social media addicts. Combine that with the higher pricetag and I don't see this having much use. 

They'd probably be better off making an app that disabled specific apps based off time and location. You're a college student who is setting aside time to study? Ok, Sunday to Thursday this app will block all social media apps and games on your phone from 1800-2100. You want to listen to music or a podcast? Sure, but no Facebook, reddit, etc. Add in some sort of bypass that can be used if you're taking a study break or not in classes this semester and you're golden."

Holy shit a frame skip.. unacceptable - Note 8 reviewers. 

What you will definitely notice is that the note actually improves a ton. I managed to get about 3-5 hours of SOT in my first week of using it - [Battery history](https://i.imgur.com/YTKXqVN.jpg). 

More recently though, I found out that I've been getting much more than I hoped - [Recent battery](https://i.imgur.com/wGgbdk8.jpg). 

My phone actually improved it's ram management and it's app power management. It has done this on the s7 edge too. 

Honestly, the Pixel phones might be smooth or faster animated than any other phone out there, but let's not turn this into a slugfest that's called a Samsung phone. Their animations are slower, yes, but turn it to 0.5x and it gets a lot faster, or turn it to zero. You won't skip out on a milisecond sooner or later. 

Nice review nonetheless, I expected someone to actually make a poor man's review but you had any flagships in the last few years 😄😄😄. 

I loled when I read carrier skins. They're OEM or manufacturer skins. Verizon doesn't make a UI, neither does AT&T :).

I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone.

this should be noted for someone about to jump the ship. and the current state of iOS (11) is a mess, take some consideration, i might suggest wait till there's a 10.3.3-stable like release. both my 6s+ and 7+ suffers a lot with iOS 11, ranged from lags when opening apps, animation stutter/jitter, battery drain (the standby time is OK tho, well... with background apps refresh and location turned off), bootscreen flicker and the most annoying thing is sudden reboot.

edit: i'm not saying that you shouldnt try iOS, what i'm saying is a little consideration/research might help to avoid further complaint/dissapoinment, especially about the current state of iOS."

Feel free to AMA, but the main reason for the switch was updates, iMessage and the Apple watch.  There are a few other minor details but overall I'm glad I made the switch.

As far as battery life, I'm pretty much going a full day without having to charge, but I'm not a power user...just a few youtube vids, podcasts, music and some browsing during the day."

One good example is how he says the text search in safari is hidden deep in menus, while on Android it’s in a menu that’s a single button press away (in that three dot menu). Except on iOS, it’s in basically the same menu. Replace three dots with a box and arrow and it’s pretty much in the same spot.

And outside of the web browser a quick flick down reveals search bars basically everywhere in the os, which last I remember is not a thing in Android (though it may be now).

Some of his other criticisms of iOS are super valid though. Apple really needs to update the look, it really does come off as the original iOS with prettier icons."

The author praises the Pixel 3a's better screen, camera, USB-C and headphone jack, notifications and home screen customization whereas the iPhone only gets the nod on build quality, iOS updates and speed. 

IMHO, if you're brand agnostic, it comes down to sets of priorities:

For $400 do you want:

* Class leading camera
* High res OLED display
* USB-C
* Modern design (Pixel 4a)

Or

* Class leading processor
* higher-end build quality
* 5 years of updates

Personally, I think we've reached a point where processor speed is becoming irrelevant. The A10 in my girlfriend's iPad is perfectly fine for day to day use. I don't notice that much of a difference between that and the A12 in my mini. Both seem nearly as responsive to me."

The iPhone SE gives me Nexus 4 vibes and magic I havent had since.... well, the nexus 4. Its a joy to use, looks good naked, and not much to complain about. And for nexus prices, its absolutely a steal.  

Im probably gonna keep using mine for at least 4 years (barring any accidents). And probably will upgrade to another apple product."

The SE battery is a massive disappointment and holds the phone back from being truly great. The only part the SE wipes the floor against the Pixel line is the chip. I had the 3a and it does everything most people would want pretty smoothly so it’s not like it’s a massive drop off anyways.

I got a Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 which has 4000maH battery. It lasts me the whole day and more (when I go sleep it is at like 40%).

I'm not a heavy user, I barely play games on my phone. I just use it for social media, discord, reddit and a bit of youtube (netflix and other multimedia I use on my iPad).

I'm worried that if I upgrade to this new SE, I'd have battery issues. Before this Redmi Note 7 I had the original SE, it was almost perfect, but the battery was horrible."

We have to waiting for direct confronts with iPhone 8 to see the battery irl. Apple declares that iPhone SE 2020 lasts the same as iPhone 8. But remember that they say the same thing with iphone8 and iPhone 7, but iPhone 8 always performs 10% better than 7"

EDIT: Per some feedback from users here, I tried locking and unlocking the device and it seems to work. It's still annoying to have to do that, but I think it's good that is reproducible. Hopefully it gets fixed some day."

At the time, I thought that the notch thing would be a temporary trend and something better than notches would come along soon. So, I thought it would be better to wait for some more time.

The lack of camera bump makes it so much easier to slide in/out of my pocket and it generally feels more comfortable in the hand. The battery lasts for more than a day with normal use (no gaming) and everything runs snappier and smoother than on my Pixel 7. My only complaint would be the slow wireless charging. It will take approximately 5 hours to charge from 0 to 100% on a wireless charger. Honestly, I carry my phone in my front pants pocket and I don't think I will go back to a phone with a camera bump again.

Easily the worst part of my P8; I wish I did more research before buying this phone I hate it so much.

It has killer features, killer specs, and is totally built for the power user.

GSMArena reports an amazing average deltaE color deviance of 1.3, which is even better than top-notch Samsung OLEDs on the S10 or Note10 line.  Plus it's a true 10-bit panel which is extremely rare on mobile or any display really.  Maybe he's just more used to the extremely oversaturated modes on most OLEDs, which I guess is what most people prefer?"

With the rumours going on that the new iPhones will go back to iPhone 4’s body with flat edges. So the new SE will most likely adapts X’s body with round body with maybe a Face ID with a 4.7 inch display. They’re going to be using the same material as the iPhone 11 with having aluminum and they’re probably gonna opt out the glass back to cut the cost.

The asset-management industry is quickly emerging as the new front in the SEC’s sweeping look into whether financial professionals are using unofficial communications to do things like cut deals, win clients or make trades. 

The agency under Chair Gary Gensler has made the issue a focus, arguing that business conducted outside of the view of a company’s compliance department can make it harder for the regulator to investigate potential wrongdoing later. The SEC has already fined banks more than $1 billion for violations.

Although the SEC had previously asked investment firms for information on policies and key staff whose texts and emails are supposed to be archived, a request to image and review the devices has sparked fresh pushback. On Tuesday, top industry trade groups sent Gensler a letter, citing “serious privacy implications.” 

Making copies of people’s phones poses risks of data breaches and exposing highly personal information, including health and financial information, or passwords, according to the letter, which was signed by the Managed Funds Association, Investment Company Institute, American Investment Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among others.

In general, money managers face less expansive SEC recordkeeping rules than brokerages, with retention focused on documents related to investment advice. But investment firms, like banks, are required to monitor communications involving their business to head off improper conduct. 

The trade groups argued that the SEC was overreaching in its request. The regulator, they said, was seeking to improperly hold investment advisers to a standard that’s meant for brokerages and not money managers.

Most of the details of the request to the hedge funds couldn’t be determined. However, the effort resembles a move by the SEC last year to demand that banks embark on a systematic search through more than 100 personal mobile phones carried by top traders and dealmakers. The push sent shivers across Wall Street.

At the time, people familiar with requests said that the process required firms to take extraordinary steps to protect privacy. Banks arranged for outside attorneys to help conduct the reviews and to act as intermediaries. The lawyers were asked to look for business-related messages. """

1. This public warning is a heads up to Ken & Steve to get rid of evidence now before a heavier handed department comes knocking with warrants and sidearms. (More likely)

2. This public warning is to entrap Kenny and Stevie for obstruction of justice by allowing them to have the warning and then giving them time to delete relevant documents. Phone records could have been collected already and this could be a test or trap to escalate charges and solidify their case. In this case SEC would have already been working with DOJ to use the corrupted relationship in a double-cross against the perps (Less likely).

They're a marketing-driven anti-feature that manufacturers should do away with. The Pixel 7 Pro display is noticeably less curved than the Pixel 6 Pro, but why not just completely unburden the user from this unpleasant design?

Amen. I don't understand Android manufacturer's obsession with curved screens. No one is buying a 7P, S22U, etc because they're curved, they're buying them because they're top of the line and the screens are usually higher resolution. 

I can't imagine those screens are cheaper so why not switch to a cheaper flat display and increase profit margins slightly?"

It's weird that the reviewer goes out of his way to minimize current and future improvements in low light photography. It felt like he already started off with a contrarian opinion that ignores normal human behavior (does he go to bars? shows? evening backyard shindigs?) and then grasped at things to back it up.

It also even feels weirder that this piece is in a publication that inherently promotes the urban arts and food scene — events that are less likely to happen midday outdoors.

"iPhone 12 mini review from The Verge: ""It’s not the best iPhone for most people, but it’s going to be a favorite for many""",https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review,2257,2257,0,404,1604935482.0,">For me, the reason to prefer the iPhone 12 mini is hard to state in words, but I’ll give it a shot. With every phone, you can tell what it was designed *around*. There’s some key feature that everything else has to contend with, that sets the hardware narrative. For many years now, that feature was the screen. Making it big, bright, beautiful, and bezel-less was the big thing driving phone design, and all other considerations were secondary.  
>  
>The iPhone 12 mini feels like the first iPhone in a long time with a different goal. It was designed around the human hand and real pockets. It is an object that doesn’t aim to be judged against other smartphones (which are mostly big now), but to be judged simply as an object you need to hold. You judge a spatula or can opener or whatever by whether it’s easy to grip, by whether it fits in your hand. It’s about time we got back to judging smartphones that way, too.  
>  
>That design decision means that other things — like battery life — are secondary. But it’s nevertheless a strange kind of relief to hold it. You know the feeling when a buzzing noise you’d grown accustomed to suddenly stops and you realize you’ve been annoyed all day but couldn’t say why? It’s like that.  
>  
>Whether we admit it or not (and whether we hate it or not), we’ve subtly been adapting ourselves to ever-growing phone sizes. The iPhone 12 mini is adapted to *us*.

But id also love to see Apple let the function of each device dictate optimal thickness. 

I’d be interested to know how much more battery the mini could squeeze in if it grew one or two mm in thickness. 

Would still be lightweight pocketable and easy to use one handed. But it might overcome the one major compromise of battery life. 


Regardless. The mini claims better battery life than the SE 2020 which I’ve been happily using for months now.

I'd say the price has a lot to do with it too. Phones are so good right now, if you want someone to upgrade, it better fucking be worth it. Raising the price doesn't help someone make the switch when performance isn't a issue on most modern phones and camera's are pretty damn good on $400 phones (pixel a series). There's a lot with this phone for me personally is overkill and probably most consumers. It would be like expecting people to buy a gaming PC for checking their e-mail and social media. They clearly fucked up by not making a S20E with some compromises, but that would satisfy the average consumer at a more friendly price point.

They are overpricing the S20 line simply cause right now flagships for Samsung is a show off line, not a selling cow line like it is for Apple. They know that money is in the mid range and low end range and flagships are just a way of Samsung showing off what it can do. Even if the S20 Ultra was priced 1000$ it would still not sell well. The S10 was priced competitively last year and it still sold shit. Heck even the S10e which was actually a great value sold shit too.

I noticed that shimmer right away, but I had to point it out to other people for them to see it; it’s one of those things you might not notice at first but you can’t un-see. Apple told me the XR display should match previous iPhone LCDs in terms of performance, but side-by-side with an iPhone 8 Plus, the off-axis shifts are definitely more pronounced.

Both have a 48 MegaPixel sensor, (probably same sensor). All Apple is doing is scaling the image down to 2x instead of 4x.

There is no reason for them to not include this feature on iphone 14 pro... other than bullshit.

So I don't consider this a feature of iphone 15 pro. I consider this Apple bullshit. It's the worst kind of Apple behavior IMO because it's something that could easily be applied to the iphone 14 pro but they choose not to.... because they're chosing to manipulate their customers rather then be honest with them.

I love Apple. I love my Apple products... but this is manipulative bullshit and people should know it.

Frankly it's disappointing that MKBHD didn't question this or test it.

Apple is fucking with us existing apple customers and I don't like it. We can have 24MP images too, all you have to do is take a 48MP raw photo with your iphone 14 Pro Max and scale it down twice. In fact MKHD should have done this in his review so he could compare the results. Why didn't he? This is lazy.

Thanks Apple, you really are shit for not including a 2x scale feature for existing iphone 14 Pro users. We will just have to do it manually.

PS: I'm a vfx artist and digital photographer. Help me understand how this isn't withholding a simple 2x scaling feature from existing customers."

Love everything the new Xperia 5 II apart from its dimensions. To me, 21:9 makes little sense. Ive never struggled to put my phone in my pocket due to its width and Sony has great apps that allow you to reach any part of a big screen using one hand. Feels like space has taken away from no reason and it just means everything is squashed across the screen."

However I wonder if Sony is always going to be behind the market leaders. 

If Sony is supplying the likes of Apple and Google with their cameras then it is likely that Apple / Google etc as the customer would have Sony agree to time sensitive non-compete periods i.e. Sony cannot launch their new Camera for 6 months after the launch of Apple.

This is just my guess but it sort of makes sense that the supplier / customer relationship is reason that Sony always seems to be 'behind' the competition, but in their case their customers."

If they can improve on these phones juuust a bit (the dim display on the 1ii, the awful selfie cameras, 5G in the US, the speakers being a little louder and deeper, and some of the weird software quirks)....
Sony is on the right track here. Utilizing their camera team in their phones is something they need to hammer down on, big time.

The 1ii was the perfect design for a phone for me, imo. No disgusting notch, front facing speakers, Toolless SD card slot, headphone jack, good amount of bezels....woof. Even with it’s shortcomings it’s still the best phone of the year for me, given it’s design language."

> The key new features include the A18 chip, which provides enhanced performance and supports Apple Intelligence, faster charging, the Action Button, an enhanced ultra wide camera with support for macro photography, revamped Photographic Styles, and the all-new Camera Control button.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 retains a similar design to the iPhone 15. The color palette has become more vibrant, with options like Ultramarine, Pink, and Teal. The camera arrangement has also been redesigned, moving from the previous diagonal layout to a vertical stack, a change that helps enable Spatial Video and Photo capture for the Vision Pro headset.

> Among the standout additions to the ‌iPhone‌ 16 is the introduction of the Action Button and the Camera Control. Previously exclusive to the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro, the Action Button is a customizable button that replaces the traditional mute switch, offering users flexibility to assign various functions such as starting voice memos or launching shortcuts. Meanwhile, the new Camera Control capacitive button, located on the right side of the device, takes smartphone photography to the next level by mimicking a physical shutter button. It also integrates gestures for adjusting settings like zoom, exposure, and more.

> One of the ‌iPhone‌ 16's key features is support for Apple Intelligence. While many of these features are still on the way with future software updates, the A18 chip underpins the phone's ability to handle the AI tools, offering improvements in performance, battery efficiency, and overall user experience.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 brings several key camera upgrades, including an improved ultra wide camera, with support for macro photography for the first time on a standard ‌iPhone‌ model. Apple has also revamped its Photographic Styles, improving how the camera handles skin tones, shadows, and highlights in real-time."

***DESIGN & THE NOTCH***

•All new design, display has curved corners and stainless steel sides could be prone to scratch. X feels very premium and solid. 

•He isn’t really bothered by the Notch. You’ll notice it in the videos, but daily use won’t be a big issue. 

***DISPLAY, FACE-ID & ANIMOJI***

•Display is very good, not too bright or overly saturated unlike Samsung. The gestures are new, but feel very natural once you get the hang of it. 

•FaceID is impressive. Works most of the time. TouchID was still more accurate (like 99%) so FaceID is pretty close (95%). It could fail sometimes, but then it also overcomes places where TouchID didn’t work.

•Animoji works solely because of the Front Camera, could’ve been there on older models. Classic “I’ve an iPhone” feature. He covered up IR and other sensors and Animoji’s still worked.

***CAMERA, PERFORMANCE & BATTERY LIFE***

•Camera is great, especially the HDR. Accurate colours & sharp details take it in the top 5. Portrait selfie needs work, it blurs out the edges. This could improve with ML in the future. The video mode for front camera is the best out there.

•A11 is fast and fluid. The most powerful chip ever in a phone,great for the future AR apps. However iOS still has some drawbacks as an OS, like the Notifications. 

•Battery life is good, gets around a full day of use. 6h of SOT and the battery life feels close to the Plus. Standby is great as usual.

***MKHBD- FINAL THOUGHTS***

He really likes the phone, his favourite iPhone. 
People spending $1000 on it won’t be disappointed, though it does have some drawbacks (Notch; No headphone jack), people who’re buying it already know this and it’s really not a dealbreaker given the perks of X. 

If there was a bigger iPhone X (X Plus?), he would totally buy that. "

Swipe up continuously like you’re throwing the app = close apps

Swipe up and let go after abruptly stopping = app switcher

Yes, Samsung manufactured the display. However, Apple played a huge role in designing it. No, they didn't just ""calibrate the colors"" to make it the best OLED display tested on DisplayMate. 

It's sad that people are reluctant to give Apple credit for anything they do because of their fanboyism. I've never seen people credit Sony for the sensors used in the Pixel cameras or TMSC for their silicon on the AX chips, yet Samsung receives all the praise here.  

This isn't a knock on MKBHD. It's just something I've noticed since the iPhone X was crowned ""The Best Display on a Smartphone""."

* The iPhone 13 Pro Max is waaaay too big!

* The Zenfone 9 is a small Android alternative to the iPhone 13 Mini!
* The Nothing Phone(1) is a normal-sized phone!

* iPhone 13 and Zenfone 9 are around the same size

Not giant, headphone jack, great performance, great speakers, good battery (I am assuming the 2h SOT is a typo), 120hz screen. I have never used wireless charging so its absence is a non-issue for me. I really hope this phone comes to Canada (which historically I think it will)/works with our bands.

The biggest drawbacks for me is the lack of telephoto but even then I'd take headphone jack + good battery any day. 2 years of updates is a bit of a bummer, but again I'd prefer to battery life and headphone jack. Android 12->13 hasn't really raised my confidence in significant software updates. I keep thinking ""maybe this time I'll get Samsung"" and then the battery life and lack of headphone jack always scare me away. 

Really bizarre score though. The review sounds like at least a 7 to me."

With BS amount of battery life, practically the most powerful CPU and GPU a phone can handle atm, and ~~two~~ headphone jack~~s~~ (unconfirmed but I saw a video that unboxed it and the phone have two), this is literally the a high-end sports car compared to any latest and upcoming iPhone that is just a budget Camaro but is still overpriced.

Imagine flexing this phone to your friends only for them to be horrified to see you playing Wordscapes on it."

I don't game on my phone and I do consider myself a gamer. The only thing I use my phone for other than making and receiving phonecalls is taking pictures, texting and reading reddit on the shitter.  


My iPhone 6 still does all this quite well."

Asus ROG Phone 2 hands-on review,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/asus-rog-phone-2-review/,1916,1916,0,436,1563785059.0,All you guys are forgetting about apps like PS4 remote play which allows you to play PS4 games on your phone. With a better processor these games will be more fun to play.
Asus ROG Phone 2 hands-on review,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/asus-rog-phone-2-review/,1916,1916,0,436,1563785059.0,I've got an Asus phone just because an employee tricked me into buying one. It's absolutely the worst phone on earth imo. Every day there seems to be a new problem with it and the only way I can get it to work properly is to factory reset the thing once it becomes unusable. A friend of mine and my sister both have one too and have constant problems.

iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,"Just ordered the 14 Pro with 256 GB - I’ve had the 6S with 64 GB for the past 7 years. Storage limitations, audio issues, and poor battery life (once replaced the battery a few years ago) on the 6S are the primary reasons I’m finally parting with it."

Nice to have the 1TB option as well."

iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,Looks great but imma hold out with my 12 until Apple goes with USBC or they get the 16. Basically I guess hoping 15 gets USBC.
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,"Based off the photos I've seen from the stock camera app. It's super clear that whatever the fuck Apple is doing in their pipeline is absolutely destroying their photos.

Their 12mp photos are dreadful and yet their 48mp RAW (untouched) photos are beautiful

I have no doubt Halide will absolutely crush it with their next update with their RAW+ format, taking advantage of that 48mp sensor"

iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,Still undecided on get the 14 Pro or the 14 Pro Max. Help!!
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,"I actually think dynamic island is a bad implementation because it forces you to interact with the top of the screen which is the hardest part to reach on the Pro Max. I would love to try it on a mini sized iPhone.

On the 13 series, all the functionality dynamic island covers, stays at the bottom of the lock screen which is by far the better place to interact with the screen."
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,"I didn't realize just how far behind the image quality was. The clarity between the Pixel and iPhone is night and day, especially at night."
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,That Island is so obstructive for content viewing. Would it have made sense to shrink notch on all phones and give the same UI around it?
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,"I want to hold out until they finally give us a Pro Mini 

I can’t give up my 12 Mini, it’s the only flagship phone that can be used with one hand"
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,Most definitely staying with 13 pro max. There is little to no difference to me in camera department - digital island as cool as it looks requires two hand use - not ideal.
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,"My iphone 14 Pro Max charges at slightly over 27.2 Watts (9.25 Volts, 2.942 Amps, 27.213 Watts) locked in rock solid for the for the first half of the charge and then tapers down from 20-27 Watts from 50-80% than drops off slower.  You need a charger that can negotiate 9V at 3A. 

Make sure to keep the phone as cold as possible so the charge speed does not throttle back as it warms up. Take it out of the case for fastest charging to help cooling. A fan or air conditioner vent hitting it helps big time. 

 I have at least 10 Chargers that will push at least 27 Watts. You can even use a USB-C 65, 95, 140Watt Macbook or Air Charger to charge at 27 Watts. 

I’ve seen some videos of 30 Watt charging using a 14.5Volt 2 Amp setting that I don’t have. that actually hits 30Watts. This might only be for the China models but in the Legal and Regulatory section on the phone in some Countries it says 14.5V at 2V."
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,Going pro max. Coming from 13 mini which gets me 4 hours of screen on time. This past winter i was splitboarding down a mountain and my binding broke. 15 minutes later the mini ran out of battery. No way to get help. Im going pro all the way. And that satellite connection is a game changer as someone who needed it desperately 6 months ago
iPhone 14 Pro Max review -- tomsguide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max,887,887,0,491,1663339316.0,"The state of Android SoCs remains pretty sad eh. Ok benchmarks aren't everything, but they're also burning more power and needing bigger batteries to get to equivalent or not even equal battery life to this. There was hope Google entering the market would change things but Tensor seems like a barely customized Exynos."
