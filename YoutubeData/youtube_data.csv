You&#39;re like a police, calling him not to overspeed on a speed limit road. | The lights should fill up as you speed and top at 96mph | I’m just happy there’s a tech company who even makes videos like that about their products and tries to get personal | I used to wonder the same thing when watching mobile camera reviews—&quot;Did they clean the camera lens before taking the shot?&quot; Not everyone thinks about that, and some people might just take the photo without considering that a smudged lens can dramatically affect the image quality. thats why i dont believe too much with some of the phone reviewers because im prettty sure some of them are bias with other brands. | Marcus needs to understand that phone company targets average people, so having loads of options in the phone is overwhelming | That thing he mentioned about keeping a  balance is so important. And it pretty much applies with every software and consumer device. | All you got to do is bury the feature under a menu and most people won&#39;t worry about it and the people who value it, will | I love how he looks up like there is someone giving him the answers. | I like how you talk calmly even when responding to criticism...It shows composure. Kudos Senior🎉 | That dust resembles the condition of the phone for a regular day to day user. An user can see how much the phone attracts dust or smudges. So cleaning it won&#39;t do that. | few CEOs would face their critics so transparently 👏 👏 👏 | I&#39;m from South Africa. I am buying the Nothing 3a. Much respect for the Nothing company and the way they do things 😎👍 | we are learning something out of nothing | Great work Carl pei | The dust suggests that he genuinely tested the device as an ordinary user would, rather than presenting it as an advertisement. | I don’t think I’ve cleaned my phone lenses a signal time in my life | What a brilliant strategy guys. I have never seen this before. I think this is a masterstroke so many new founders and companies missed out on. | It is very important to review a reviewer especially by the companies so that the consumers can have both side opinions. | Exactly that. You can’t go from 0-100 while in a 60. Got to slowly come up to speed then when your customer base is ready expand."

You guys think I should just go ahead and get the s25? | Suggest Samsung to continue with S24 ultra design. It looks more premium than the new design of S25 ultra. | Beautiful phone!! I just got the 1TB jade green for $800 from my Supplier, and Pinkgold for my wife💟💟We loveee it! | I just got the S25 Ultra and it&#39;s amazing but I like the way the 24 looks with the square edges | S24 ultra looks way better🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ | I use S24 Ultra and am impressed with the S24 Ultra. I still follow Samsung&#39;s products. If in the future, using iPhone with Samsung will be a perfect fit for me. # Thailand | Mine was s24U am satisfied with it. I won&#39;t upgrade to 25 hell nah. I lov the sharp edges of s24U ❤️❤️❤️ | I prefer the design of the S24 Ultra. 🥰 | Got the S25U. The S24U looks way more premium and better screen. Thinking to go back to the S24U | How did u make ur apps like that? | S24 Ultra for the win.🎉🎉🎉 | How did you do that app spinning thing 😮😮😮 | I still love my galaxy note 20 ultra ❤<br>The screen size is bigger | How did you get your apps/screen to do that?? | I&#39;m still happily rocking my S22U. I recently did a factory reset, and it feels buttery smooth new again. 😅 | Which launcher or theme is this | I have already S25 Ultra ❤ | Как сделать такой же шар из приложений? | How to get this type of theme"

Sony hardware+google software=🔥🔥 | I use a Sony Xperia 1 from 2021 and I still enjoy using this phone and I still see no problems with using it in 2025. | I am Sony fan, all of their electronics gadgets like mp3 player, 🎧, TV, home theater, portable speaker, hard disk, laptop and obviously mobile. All I have or once had from the brand. <br>Initially two smart phones was of Experia. I love Sony as always. Love to pay extra to the Japanese brand. | My last sony was xperia z, prior to that Arc this brought tears to my eyes. | Incase of 3.5mm jack, india manufacturers should learn from sony | I hate that they removed 4k display because sony was the only brand which provided 4k display on smartphone 😢 | Sony is great at everything they do. Sony is the goat no questions asked | I just wish this would come to India, even if in official imported form by Sony India | The greatest point is that this flagship phone is having micro sd card slot. No flagship phones  offer that now. | It is pretty evident that other manufacturers removed headphone jacks and proper stereo speakers to force customers into buying their wireless products.<br>Sony meanwhile didn&#39;t have to worry about it since their core are of business before phones was audio and TV&#39;s. | expandable memory option would have been revelutionary if added | This is call ed proper flagship | You forgot to mention SD Card | Sony&#39;s smartphone is actual flagship .... Provide almost everything... No useless fancy things .. | Actually in my opinion this phone is for only professional photographers end photographers because this camera has lot of potential. | I used Xperia SP in white colour. Just Absolute Beauty. No phone  can match the love i have for that phone. That transparent part at the bottom with changing colors blinking so bright..❤❤"

Just compare the back of the phone if you want to compare | I agree tbh , that&#39;s a fair point.<br><br>Although I also remember how Carl keeps comparing the nothing devices with iPhones &amp; how he is inspired by Apple.<br>It won&#39;t be foreign if that bleeds into his products , knowingly or unknowingly. | &quot;I saw the difference in half a second.&quot;<br><b>you&#39;re literally the ceo of the company</b> 😭 🙏 | He should had said - see you can have cooler iPhone for fraction of the cost | How many Reupload u guys want 😭😭😭😭 | I wish Nothing 3 comes with 8 gen 3 / 8s gen 3 | The difference is: iPhone corners are more round than any other phone. | There is a reason he wants his phones to be directly compared with iPhone. | I wish nothing phone 3 doesn&#39;t come with SD 7s gen 3😅😢 | Huge respect for nothing CEO but still miles to go 😢❤ | What&#39;s up with people comparing every phone to an iPhone | They&#39;ll also have the same aspect ratio as well, because it makes it easier for devs to deploy hybrid apps. | I seriously don’t know what the obsession is with having something ‘different’ - of course as a reviewer it’s harder if things only have minor differences but at this stage we’re all carrying a computer around in our pocket - it needs a big screen and good battery. The rest is software. Love what nothing is doing as a company at least making it look unique, but the we’re at peak mobile device. It’s like complaining that wheels are round. | I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad to copy the good part. I like the iPhone&#39;s symmetrical bezels but also like android as my daily driver OS | Yes he is right, front of phones is almost identical these days. | Not being able to distinguish two black slabs is one thing , having the same dimensions is a completely different thing😂 | I can see the difference between the two phones because I own a Nothing cmf phone | fair point but he was talking about edges curviness r exactly same as apple     like screen size &amp; that | &quot;Any phone would be similar &quot;<br>S24 ultra: 😂"

And i love it... | Carl Pei is most chill and calm CEO out there | I&#39;m loving this, a CEO responding to us. Keep at it NOTHING. | Respectfully Mr Carl..I was with OnePlus till you left. And then I moved to the nothing 1. Still rocking it with my kid. I think it&#39;s a good option to keep both options available. For me, like the telegram logo/color makes it easier for me to focus and find it when I need it. Monochrome makes it more harder for me. | I&#39;m a long time Samsung user, honestly seeing the CEO of a company being so down to earth is incredibly refreshing. ❤ | i love it how a reviewer is being reviewed!! crazy | #1 reason for me is seeing your project and having a CEO and company communicate their ideas in a way that makes you feel included and part of the journey | Carl looks absolutely high every single time. Goat CEO | Got Nothing 2A yesterday and the phone feels exciting. Thanks for all the hard effort Nothing team has put in to this. | I like how he pronounced Arun’s name the right way | The monochrome display was the major reason why I made my choice for the Nothing phone. I love this balanced and calm UI. | I love how chill and calm also honest with whatever he says about the brand | I&#39;ve been using nothing 2a for 5 months, and I love every part of it, the design, monocrome app icons, widgets, back eveything! good job. | I love my Nothing Phone 1 and 2. Both have fantastic software, great hardware and are priced well. I can&#39;t wait for Nothing 3! | I hope i could afford this perfect piece of technology.. Nothing you&#39;re one of the coolest companies currently in the market, please expand to more products such as speakers, headphones, televisions.. | Hi Carl, soon to be nothing user here. Phone (2a) will be my first android phone and I think I’ve chosen the right one. I love your vision. | Yes, the monochrome mode does look amazing! | I always like clean interface 👍 | ngl.. I like the fact that a CEO of a major tech company, speaks directly to consumers in a non scripted way instead of in a carefully prepared by a PR firm show."

Kaunsa maal liya hai mujhe v bej doh | Bought 3a pro a few weeks back. Having a smooth UI experience with some lags here and there. Battery lifes good. Camera is really awesome. All n all if you want a phone that brings clean UI along with balanced quality in almost every aspect, it is for you. | Bhai 7s gen 3 10 august 2024 ko launch hua tha | Bro snapdragon 7 gen 3 was launched last year .. | Guys I&#39;m using Nothing 3a Pro from past 15 days. Great experience, no lag and the best. For gaming (BGMI), it gives 120fps but not constant. Also snapdragon 7s gen3 is not 2yrs old processor it&#39;s still the best. Camera is also so good, and the periscope lens makes it even more better. If you have budget of 30k, I&#39;d prefer Nothing 3a Pro any day! | No it&#39;s better than moto , superb camera quality+ videography especially nothing phone | Bhai Phone ko chalana hai pani main girana nahi hai | Yes, Snapdragon 7s is not meant for gaming but it&#39;ll still give you a decent performance, ofcourse if you want to do gaming hardcore, go with the better specs. But it&#39;s not necessary that ufs 2.2 is worse than other types, I&#39;ve seen majority of cases where ufs 2.2 performes better than ufs 3.1, it just depends on the optimisation algorithm of the mobile. In nothing&#39;s case, the optimisation is quite good, hence it&#39;ll give you quite a good performance. | I recently bought the 3a pro. It was the best purchase heres why: works on bgmi with 120 fps, the camera beats iphone 16 pro and s24 iltra (i tested it side by side) the ui feels the best, premium feeels and even the phone itself looks astonishing. Even thought it has a ip64 rating, you&#39;ve ovbiously not using it in water so conclusion, its like the best. Ill leave the rest on you | Nothing is not left for the compitition, its the brand, know the quality before you speak 😂 | Guys I&#39;m using the 3a Pro, bought on 30 March 2025. I can say that its a great phone overall! | 😂😂😂 I am watching from nothing phone 3a 🎉 | Thank you for your review bro I already buying 😄 | Just to let you know the ufs 2.2 is dual lane so it&#39;s all good and fast and for the chipset you can get 120 fps in bgmi and 90 fps in most games | Ip68 paani chale jaayga toh warranty dega kya yeh bata pahele | Bro are you sure that snapdragon 7s gen 3 is two years old. Once you check in google it is showing released on August 20th  2024 | Only differentiating factor at this segment is the camera of the moto vs coolness of nothing | If we are gona compare phones like that, then no phone is perfect. You have to consider that whats the amount you are paying. | My uncle got an ip 69 rating phone 5 years ago and he still hasnt dropped it in water. Ip ratings matter only if you&#39;re more outdoors. | Water damage? Dude my 3a pro fell in pool for about 5 mins and after finding it, it still works smoothly and no any problem"

If UFS 2.2 is an issue, switch off ram expansion. I request this creator to not just look blindly at the specs but also talk about its usability and practicality in day-to-day scenarios. By watching this video please don&#39;t come to the assumption that the Motorola is better. It is damn good phone but if u are not a heavy user than Nothing is far better. Software experience, regular updates and reliability of flat display with great cameras is the reason why I would choose the Phone 3a over Motorola. If u like Moto then I respect you choice. Each phone is targeted to a particular Niche. Pls understand this and create informative content. U might have covered all this in your long form videos but people&#39;s final decision is shaped by the videos they daily see either through shorts or yt videos. I personally feel that IP69 is the most gimmicky and useless feature to exist. No one is going to use their phone underwater. Companies can offer soo much more through removing this feature. IP69 does not mean that it is necessarily durable. <br>THANK YOU . | Thank for clear my confusion 🎉😊😊 | Moto is must better, mene le lia bahut acha performance hai | I am watching the video on my Motorola Edge 60 Pro 😄🤗 | Switched from moto g515g to nothing 3a.

Moisture issue in USB port<br>2. Dolby sound reduces <br>3. The charging algorithm won&#39;t match with other chargers (68 watt/65 watt) | Do u have financial or otherwise coordination with moto? | Both phones are not good, better to settle for around 15-17 K phone. I have moto edge 60 pro - Camera is not good specially for night photo shoot. It cannot handle LED light and disturb every snap. UI Crashes sometimes."

In this review I go over whether or not the Galaxy S24 is basic or if it's amazing.,2024-02-19T14:00:18Z,JSL Review,1174013,35847,,"Who’s on the regular S24 or S24 Plus?? | Me watching this on an S24 Ultra: it&#39;s a little too late for that 😅 | I’d buy the regular S24 because I don’t want a mini tablet in my pocket | In part of Europe or Asia. I would prefer s23 series than the regular s24 itself. You know, exynos had really bad reputation | In India here, they tried to screw us over by selling their Exynos version.<br><br>Instead, no one bought it and only Ultra sold well | Dude the s pen does an insane amount of things its not only for writing its literally a remote for the phone... | Same Snapdragon good Joke Bro, only in USA. Rest of the world gets the shitty exynos crab. 😢 | Is not about the s pen, but many people go for the ultra cause the size and cameras | The 5x zoom was important to me, but if it wasnt I would go for the base model | I will never go without my S pen!!!!! | I like the big screen. Plus, I got big hands. | I use the S Pen a lot, having gotten used to use one with a tablet | A few days ago, I accidentally ran over my A71 at work. So, after I got off, I went and got an S24 Ultra. I personally wanted the bigger screen as I travel full-time and don&#39;t have a TV. So my phone is how I watch movies and TV shows. Basically, it all comes down to personal preference. | Once you go pen... you don&#39;t go back. The ultra is not about using the pen 24/7. It&#39;s about it being there when you finally need to use it.<br><br>Edit: Can everyone chill in the comment section? I don&#39;t care if everyone in the world hates or likes the S-pen. I know what i like, you know what you like. Lets just respect different opinions so i dont need to be pinged forever about this comment that I made months ago. | My true reasons for using the S-Pen<br><br>4. When i want to take full control of screenshot and screenshot editing with precise screen writing.<br><br>3. Easier for editing check stubs/ documents to meet or help friends meet the qualification of something<br><br>2. Signing (or editing) PDFs and sending them back in record timing<br><br>1. Editing watermarks out of my kids school pictures<br><br>I dont use it all the time but i absolutely dont want to be without it. Sort of like my jumper cables. I cant remember the last time my car died. But I&#39;ve jumped peoples car like twice this year.<br><br>OTHER people might have something to do that requires your S-Pen | I got the S24 literally last week and I don&#39;t buy fancy new phones but I tried to buy an S20 (last one to hold SD cards) and they don&#39;t work anymore and there are no more updates from Samsung. Then all a sudden the S24 was on sale down from $1200aud to $877 which is literally half the price of the plus. So I got it. Love it just a little small after years of my old S10 plus. But otherwise it&#39;s a rocket and half the price of the ultra. | Personally i hate the ultras, i prefer the round edges and flat screens its just more aesthetically pleasing | the reason i bought note 9 second hand some times ago is because its the most affordable stylus phone that i could buy at the time that still works ok. truly an on site work phone. take photos, draw arrows, circles, jot notes directly, and sent it to other division in real time, its precise so you can write smaller and longer sentences without zooming and its readable. very nice. should be on cheaper mid range phone with big battery rather than as a complementary stuff on the top of your product line. way better than carrying rugged big tablet with poor battery stylus for on site job. you tend to baby those expensive phone so it lasts long but it defeats the puropse of having stylus on a phone in the first place. its for work. | From the looks I prefer the regular s23 <br>I don&#39;t like those sharp edges | If it had the SPen it would be a yes, can&#39;t be without it"

This is in contrast to Google&#39;s approach, which generally produces a more natural result.  While the iPhone&#39;s default setting uses a 24MP sensor, and Google&#39;s a 12MP sensor, the level of sharpening applied by the iPhone can sometimes make even 200MP images appear less detailed.

This is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to reviews online, as it almost always never gets done | I feel brands should come up with new phones once every 2 or 3 years now. Reduce waste. More sustainable. And the upgrades are worthwhile. | We have reached peak phone stagnation! | The event hasn&#39;t even started | I only watch these videos about every 3-4 years these days since upgrading phones hasn&#39;t become a necessary yearly or every other year thing anymore (due to the longer lasting and proficient enough features of past models). With that being said, I would have liked to see this review go into more depth on design and features that phones from the past didn&#39;t have, rather than leading with the assumption that the vast majority of the audience was already familiar with what you were referring to. I know I, for one, was not familiar with the boxed-edge design similar to iPhone.<br><br>You mentioned it coming with a stylus and the former model having a Bluetooth compatability. I would&#39;ve liked to see what all that was about since my S21 didn&#39;t have any of that before. Call me &quot;Unc&quot; or old for having an S21, but it was only upgraded 3 years ago despite the S22 being available, I got a much better deal settling for the 21. I understand you push these videos out fast to be the first to get your review out for the masses, but sometimes taking that extra time to understand the product before pushing a review can do you longer term success by giving your audience more of what they needed to feel educated or informed about a product. | Removing the Bluetooth feature on the new S Pen was a mistake. Though not widely used, it was passionately used by vloggers who used the phone. Starting and stopping the camera with the S Pen is convenient. | The event is live now and MKBHD posting  this one just 15 seconds after 💀 | Arun: It&#39;s the start of a new era<br>Marques: can&#39;t tell the difference | Not Happy With my new S25Ultra Phone. They REMOVED the Super Slow-Motion Video Feature, now you only get up to 240 fps. If I knew that before buying, I would have kept my previous model. DO NOT BUY if Super Slow-Motion is at all important. Big loss for me not to have that capability. | I searched for galaxy unpacked and your video was above the actual samsung unpacked event 😭 | You know Marques is unimpressed, when he speaks about the case for more than a minute in a 9-minute review. | This dude has his video uploaded before Samsung can even blink! | I loved the old GIF method on the note. You removed the S-pen, clicked the button, and it brought up a wheel of 5 or 6 things... you picked GIF and it brought up a frame, you moved the frame over what you wanted to clip and hit record. It worked really well. | Really can’t believe the only substantial change Samsung made to the S25 was adding more AI features… which Google built… and will come to older Galaxy phones in a software update. Basically, they’re selling us a fresh logo and vibes. | Oh, we’re here already… I concider myself a bit of a tech nerd but even I’m starting to kind of forget about these yearly phones and events. They almost seem to come and go now without leaving you much to think or talk about. <br><br>The FOMO feeling I used to have with new phones is almost completely gone now and that’s kinda nice. | Watching on my S23 Ultra wondering if it&#39;s time to upgrade. You answered that for me in 26 seconds. Thanks MKBHD | That&#39;s our website shown at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAb4zRyxrD4&amp;t=68"">1:08</a> - you have great taste MKBHD ;)"

My Ultra s are both 1 TB, which edges out the Edge. | Just imagine:<br><br>iPhone 17 Air vs Galaxy S25 Edge | S25 ultra for me still | Should be under 1K | I can&#39;t decide between the Edge and the Ultra 😭 | Question<br><br>Is there screen protector on s25 Ultra? | We want smaller ultra phone not thinner !!!!!!!!!!! | Doesn&#39;t make sense at all <br>3900 mah won&#39;t even last a full day <br><br>You most probably need to charge it twice even for basic use <br>For heavy use thrice a day<br><br><br>While just giving a few bucks extra you got s25 ultra which lasts a full day even in moderate use case <br><br>If you can fit same battery of s25 ultra in thin phone than only it makes sense <br><br>Or at least give 90-120w fast charging 😅 | I want tiny mobiles and not thin ones | Esos modulos de cámara tienen un toque mucho mas premium! Asi es... 🫶🏼🤳🏼 | S25 ultra | Nice phone , I hink that I am going to get one ,I just told my sis thats the phone to get. Loaded | I often play games, and I&#39;m worried about the battery. | Edge is such a scam | That s25 ultra screen looks scratched | When Apple announced they were making a thin phone, Samsung made a thin phone.<br>Also, this looks EXACTLY like the iPhone 16.<br>They just make a bootleg iPhone 16 that is thinner, and sold it for 300$ more. | Just buy a mint S21 Ultra in black and call it a day | Samsung totally MAD | Ultra by miles"

The diamond cut edges, the beats audio etc... such a good phone | The iPhone 12 pro copy and paste clip is hilarious 😅 | It&#39;s really a shame HTC disappeared... they made good phones. I used the HTC M8 for the longest time! | I remember Overclocking phones with custom ROMS to over 1.6 Gigahertz 😂😂. The good Old days When Android was Truly Free | The htc m7 and m8 were masterpieces. The design still looks phenomenal. It was way ahead of its time. | He is a man of culture for having the McLaren OnePlus,my brother had that phone for ever and it looks gorgeous and it never broke until this day | Htc m7 and m8 are hands down 2 of the best phone ever produced. Miss my M8 all the time. | I wish HTC still made phones. | I had the blue HTC ONE from Best Buy. Still have it lying around. My favorite phone of all time. | I&#39;m still using and watching this on Oneplus 7t pro mclaren edition. This phone&#39;s a beast🗿 | The Motorola Droid is a legendary phone | Notice the only one he felt the need to explain himself on was the year he used the iPhone the most 😂 | HTC One was a beast. I kept changing the ROM and upgrade it. I think I had that one for 5 years. In the end it completely looked like an iPhone (not just the homescreen, but everything. Such a brilliant thing. | All the phones i used, nokia 6600, nokia 7610, blackberry 9300, nokia N95, nokia N96, iphone 3gs, iphone 4S, iphone 5, iphone 5s, iphone 6s, iphone 7 plus, iphone x, iphone xs, iphone 12 pro max, iphone 15 pro max | XDA developers was the GOAT during those early android times, even now they&#39;ve started porting s24/25 rom to s20 and below.. | using the oneplus 7t pro since december 2019, still works perfectly, amazing performance. Only thing that makes me wanna buy a new phone is having one with 5g support tho plan to use this phone until its unusable. Battery life still lasts the whole day as I used to keep it between 20% and 90% | That Google nexus was something special 😊 | Note 2 was ahead of everyone, it was the big phone revolution! Nothing is too big of a phone after that."

It's not that the iPhone 16 Pro is a bad ...,2025-01-01T14:00:29Z,JSL Review,267943,5567,,"I upgraded from an 11 pro. No point getting the 15 Pro, as the 16 Pro is a more refined version. And there’s no way I could wait another year with my battery health being 64% | iPhone 16 Pro is a good phone Don’t let other people change your mind. | Faster chip (as always)<br>Extra ram<br>48mp ultrawide camera<br>Apple intelligence<br>That&#39;s not really the same as last years<br>Plus... WHO UPGRADES THEIR PHONE EVERY YEAR???? | It was a great upgrade for me coming from a base 13. | Wdym it&#39;s the worst phone of 2024?<br>I upgraded from a 12 Pro to 16 Pro and it&#39;s so much better in terms of battery life and having that 120 refresh rate is so good. | Dude you literally get a new iPhone every year. It’s the not an upgrade to you personally. But for others it’s a big upgrade. | I&#39;ve got a 14 pro (from an iPhone 11), will never go back to a 60hz refresh rate screen and will wait until my battery health is below 80% before replacing it and will wait until a revolutionary iPhone comes out to replace my current. | iPhone 16pro is not for people using iPhone 15pro it’s for people still using iPhone 11,12,13  or even older versions like me 😄😄 | If you want half the battery life choose 15 pro | I actually use the camera button a lot. It makes taking quick pics super easy. | This is false. The camera quality is better than iPhone 15. | What?? If it’s the same phone as last year how is it worse??? | upgrade from a base 7 to a base 16 it’s a major upgrade for me | I just upgraded from a samsung a52s to an iphone 16 pro for my birthday and i love it | I just use the button to open the camera. After that I just use the camera as normal ppl | I upgraded from 15 pro max to 16 pro max. And test them side by side by making content and I notice a huge difference in the camera. 16 pro max shots are brighter and crispier especially in 2x shots both picture and videos while maintaining the highlights better. I didn&#39;t notice any difference in sharpness tho. <br><br>I just made sure first before selling my 15 pro max. Or returning my 16 pro max. But yea, I just ended up selling my 15 pro max. 16 pro max is not a huge upgrade from 15 pro max. But when it comes to camera and battery, I just think it is huge. | Compared to the 15 pro, the 16 pro is a lot better | ‘It’s virtually the same phone as last year’…you can pretty much say that every year a new phone comes out🥴 | Gulp I have the black iPhone 16 pro | As someone who came from an iPhone 11 the iPhone 16pro is a great update just don’t upgrade it every year like some people do it’s unnecessary."
